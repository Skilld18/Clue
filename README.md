First problem the upper bound on a 3 player game is manageable as already shown but the worst case is a 6 player game.
Less cards are certain from the onset
6 choose 1 * 3 * 15 choose 3 * 12 choose 3 * 9 choose 3 * 6 choose 3 = 3027024000 this might run really slow but it's now
a generator so it should run slow but eventually complete
It's technically a csp, look for libs that can construct sets based on csp?
